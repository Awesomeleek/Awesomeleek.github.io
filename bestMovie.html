	<h1>Best Movie: Inception</h1>
	<p>The reason why I like this movie is because it shows the complexity of life through the lens of many different angles.</p>
	
	<p>My favorite actor in the movie was Leonardo Dicaprio because I thought he was suited for the main character and was able to perform the action stunts very well.</p>
