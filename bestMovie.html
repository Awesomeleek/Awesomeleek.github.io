	<p style="color:blue;font-family:verdana;font-size:130%;">The reason why I like this movie is because it shows the complexity of life through the lens of many different angles.</p>
	
	<p style="color:red;font-family:courier;font-size:160%;">My favorite actor in the movie was Leonardo Dicaprio because I thought he was suited for the main character and was able to perform the action stunts very well.</p>
