		<h2>Name Assignment</h2>
		<p>
			<img src="images/nameassignment.jpg" width="400" height="300"/>
		</p>
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>It was a project that used Scratch to design a program that shows the name of the user. There needed to be at least three different styles for the whole name and it needed to play when the green flag was clicked. It also needed to reset when it was stopped.</p>
		<h3>Concepts Learned:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Using event blocks- These blocks allowed the process of something to begin</li>
			<li>Conditional statements- These include “if then” statements that allowed a process to begin if something were to happen</li>
			<li>Forever loops- These loops allow for something to continually happen throughout the project unless specifically told to stop</li>
			<li>Sprites- The sprites could be designed or chosen from a preset list on Scratch</li>
			<li>Movement- The x and y values were used to allow the sprites to move from one location to another on the stage</li>
		</ul>		
		
		
		<h2>Computer Buying Project</h2>
		<p>
			<img src="images/computerbuyingproject.jpg" width="400" height="300"/>
		</p>
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>This was a project that required everyone to research a minimum of four computers based on interview answers of what someone wanted in a computer. The use of google slides was not permitted, so the majority used Scratch and either made an animation or slides on the site. At the end, one of the computers were chosen to be the winner and best option for the person who was interviewed.</p>

		<h2>Final Project</h2>
		<p>
			<img src="images/finalproject.jpg" width="400" height="300"/>
		</p>
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>This was a project that allowed students to choose whether to make an animation or a game. I chose to make a game. The requirements were that there needed to have a counter, a score, and that the levels progressed in difficulty as the game goes on. I created three levels that progressed in difficulty and the goal was to have the main sprite, the ball, reach the key without touching any enemies, the bats, or red areas. There were even bonus items that awarded extra time or extra points.</p>
