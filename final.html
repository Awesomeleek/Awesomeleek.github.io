		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>For this assignment, I decided to make a game where there are three main paths that a player can choose and that will determine which types of games they will play. I used knowledge that we learned from before to make several scenes and tried to make the game very diverse. I made a game to be open world, action based, Q&A, time based, luck based, and had proponents that were randomly generated so that the game would be fresh everytime it was replayed. I also implemented a lot of music and timing that seem to fit the scenario or game. I programmed controls that include the letter keys, arrow keys, and the mouse, in order to change up the way games are played. There were several sprites that were used, several broadcasts, several if and else statements, and several variables. I even incorporated a list into one of the games that would display information vital to the gameplay.</p>
